    <h1>I Taught Myself To Live Simply</h1>
    
    <p>I taught myself to live simply and wisely,<br>
to look at the sky and pray to God,<br>
and to wander long before evening<br>
to tire my superfluous worries.</p> 

    <p>When the burdocks rustle in the ravine<br>
and the yellow-red rowanberry cluster droops<br>
I compose happy verses<br>
about life's decay, decay and beauty. </p>
